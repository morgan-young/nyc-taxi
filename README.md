# New York City Taxi Dataset Analysis

Analysis of a 1bn+ row data file.

This is some analysis on taxi trips taken in NYC and fares associated with them. For a company looking to compete with the NYC taxi incumbents, like Uber or Lyft, this would be an extremely valuable dataset that holds insight into things like where the most pickups/dropoffs happen for NYC taxis, average fares, average ride lengths and would establish a solid base for competitive analysis and help in creating a unique value proposition.

This file is over 1 billion (1bn) lines long and as such would not be suitable for analysing with Excel or most common BI tools run on local computers due to the computational demands of manipulating this data.

I performed this analysis with a Python package, Vaex, which is bleeding edge tech and enables me to analyse huge files on a normal computer which would be a really useful product insight and product decision making skill to have available on a start up or scale up company team.
